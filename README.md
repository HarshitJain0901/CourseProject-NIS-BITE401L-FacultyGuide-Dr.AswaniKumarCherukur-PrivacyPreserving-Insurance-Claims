# Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Medical Insurance Claim Processing using Homomorphic Encryption

**Course Title**: Network and Information Security  
**Course Code**: BITE401L  
**Institution**: VIT Vellore  
**Department**: SCORE  
**Faculty Guide**: Dr. Aswani Kumar Cherukuri

## Project Overview  
This project implements a Blockchain-integrated privacy-preserving medical insurance claim verification system using Homomorphic Encryption. It allows secure verification of encrypted medical data for insurance claims without compromising patient privacy.  
---

## Core Technologies  
Blockchain (Ethereum, Truffle, Ganache) for integrity and tamper-proof storage  
Homomorphic Encryption (CKKS via TenSEAL) for privacy-preserving computation  
SHA-256 Hashing for integrity verification  
AES Encryption for secure off-chain file encryption  
---

## Features  
End-to-end encryption of patient data using CKKS scheme  
Blockchain-based verification of data integrity and timestamp  
Model inference on encrypted data for insurance approval/denial  
Off-chain storage with tamper detection using stored hash comparison  
CLI interface for data submission and result decryption  
---

## Workflow  
1. User inputs medical details through the CLI  
2. Data is encrypted using CKKS and AES and then hashed (SHA-256)  
3. The SHA-256 hash and metadata are stored on the blockchain  
4. Encrypted files are stored off-chain (e.g., local/IPFS/S3)  
5. On retrieval, AES decrypts the file, and hash is recomputed  
6. If the hash matches, integrity is verified. Otherwise, tampering is detected
